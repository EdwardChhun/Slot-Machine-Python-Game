# Slot-Machine-Python-Game
This is a project I worked on with a little tweaks, I got inspired by Tech with Tim, an awesome creator on the Youtube platform. This project helped me understand the feedback of error from the terminals, user inputs, debugging, other advance functions such as enumerate and splat operator. You can try to run this code on your editor in python :)
